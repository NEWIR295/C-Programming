 *      Project Description:
 *      	The Student Management System is a C program designed to manage student
			information efficiently. It allows the user to perform various operations
			such as adding new students, displaying all students, searching for a
			student by ID, updating student details, calculating the average GPA,
			and finding the student with the highest GPA.
			This system utilizes fundamental programming concepts including conditions
			,loops, strings, structs, and pointers, besides the ability to use data
			structures efficiently like the linked list.
