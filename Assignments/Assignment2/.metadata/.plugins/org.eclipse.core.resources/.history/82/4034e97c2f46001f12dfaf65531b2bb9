/*
You are designing a poster which prints out numbers with a unique
style applied to each of them. The styling is based on the number of
closed paths or holes present in a giver number. The number of holes
that each of the digits from 0 to 9 have are equal to the number of closed
paths in the digit. Their values are:
• 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7 = 0 holes.
• 0, 4, 6, and 9 = 1 hole.
• 8 = 2 holes.
Given a number, you must determine the sum of the number of holes for
all of its digits. For example, the number 819 has 3 holes.
Function Description
Complete the function countHoles. The function must return an integer
denoting the total number of holes in num.
